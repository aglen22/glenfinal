<h3>Part I</h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Hi! My name is Amy, and the institution I chose for my project is the United Kingdom’s National Portrait Gallery (NPG), which is based in London.</li>
 <li>The NPG was founded in 1856, and the museum’s collections include portraits, paintings, sculptures, miniatures, light -sensitive works on paper, photographs, drawings, and manuscripts (Fouseki & Vacharopoulou, 2013, p. 5).</li>
 <li>The NPG is thought to be the very first national public art gallery dedicated to portraits.</li>
 <li>The NPG sees art as a means to promote “understanding of the men and women who have made and are making British history and culture” (National Portrait Gallery, 2020)</li>
 <li>The mission of the NPG is “to be the foremost centre for the study of and research into portraiture (through extensive display, exhibition, research, learning, outreach, publishing, and digital programmes), and to make its work and activities of interest to as wide a range of visitors as possible” (Fouseki & Vacharopoulou, p. 5).</li>
 <li>I became interested in the NPG while writing my research paper, as the museum’s stance as the copyright holder of all museum images was unique, as emphasized by a lawsuit against Wikipedia (Fouseki & Vacharopoulou, pp.5-6).</li>
 </ul>

<h4> Project Objectives</h4>
  <a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/footer/accessibility?_gl=1*1ccb5kf*_up*MQ..*_ga*Mjg2Mzg2MDgzLjE3NTQ4NTk3MDU.*_ga_3D53N72CHJ*czE3NTQ4NTk3MDUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ4NTk3MDUkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank">National Portrait Gallery Accessibility Statement</a>
  <br>
  <ul>
  <li>The NPG has a published Accessibility Statement, with a stated desire that they “want as many people as possible to be able to use this website” (National Portrait Gallery, 2025). The NPG also states that users should be able to use assistive tools to improve their experience.</li>
  <li>While this sounds great, the museum does acknowledge that there are parts of their website that is not accessibility friendly, and recommends users with accessibility devices use sites such as AbilityNet to learn how to adjust the settings on their devices.</li>
  <li>This sounded strange to me, and the thought of family members with disabilities not being able to fully use the site bothered me, so I wanted to explore how accessibility friendly the site was.</li>
  </ul>
 

<h4>The Current System</h4>

<p><img src="https://finalprojectimages5.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/axiellrelationaldatabase.jpg" 
    alt="Axiell Relational Database Model-Chart from Gregory, 2020"
    class="center" </p>

 <ul>
 <li>The NPG uses Mimsy XG, a Collections Management Software, which is a product of the software company Axiell. Axiell is a vendor with many different cultural heritage based software options (National Portrait Gallery, 2020).</li>
 <li>A Collections Management Database is a type of Content Management System (CMS), which, in its broadest sense, refers “to all the various technologies used to collect and manage information for distribution or publication in any medium” (Miller, 2014, p. 255).</li>
 <li>Mimsy XG is built using a relational database model, which is when data is structured in tables and relationships between points of data are defined (Miller, p. 257; Gregory, 2020).</li>
 <li>Axiell databases allow cultural heritage institutions to catalog collections, manage acquisitions and loans, and manage organization and status needs to collections (ex: preservation status). Additionally, Axiell databases can be used by staff and users through multiple devices and do not require much time to learn how to use (Axiell, n.d.-a).</li>
 <li>Mimsy has input options for image rights and restrictions, which has been a concern of the NPG for many years as the institution views photographs of works as museum property (Fouseki & Vacharopoulou, pp. 4-5).</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Evaluation of the System</h4>
<p><img src="https://finalprojectimages5.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/latervictorianportraitsandheinzarchiveandlibrary.jpg" 
    alt="Later Victorian Portraits Catalog & Heinz Archive & Library Catalog"
    class="center" </p>

<ul>
<li>In order to provide a thorough assessment of this information system, I had to narrow the scope and focus on specific search functions, which are as follows: Research Programmes (Later Victorian Portraits) and the Heinz Archive and Library site.</li>
<li>These catalogs operate as independent systems and are not linked.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Later Victorian Portraits</h4>
<ul>
<li>After selecting Later Victorian Portraits, a wall of text explains this was one of the first individual period catalogs to be published online (National Portrait Gallery, n.d.-e).</li>
<li>After selecting ‘Search the catalogue”, the user sees more instructions that states they can search this catalog in the following ways: select one of five professional categories, keyword search by sitter name, keyword search with faceted categories under “found in”, or A-Z lists of sitters or artists.</li>
<li>If I start by selecting a category, such as “Artists and art world figures”, multiple pages with different profiles of artists and subjects or sitters. I do have the option to search by term, choose an A-Z list of sitters or artists, perform an advanced search, explore more general information about Victorian portraiture, or a help button with tips for improving my search.</li>
<li>All of these search options yield useful results provided a user is searching by a specific name. Searches for painter John Everett Millais or actress Lillie Langtry yield profile results with a biography about the person and information about the painting or photograph that represents the person.</li>
<li>A search by the last name of an individual yields results, but they are not necessarily relevant to the individual being searched for. Searching by Rossetti or Millais can work, but this search is not very effective.</li>
<li>A keyword search is only helpful if you are searching for a name. If I wanted to search using the term “globe” out of an interest of portraits containing globes, I do not find any results.</li>
<li>If I try the search option with a limited faceted search menu, it is only helpful if you have a specific name or family to search for. Facets such References, Reproductions and Provenance do change the search results and provide more detailed information.</li>
</ul>

         <td>Does not bring up biography, but all results with name</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

<h4>Heinz Archive & Library</h4>
<ul>
<li>For the next part of my evaluation, I will examine the Archive and Library catalog of the Heinz Archive and Library. It is important to note that this catalog provides scholarly research on artists, historical trends, and on museum collections.</li>
<li>Search options include a simple keyword search with a start over button in the event a search is unsuccessful. Users can also select show search options to be able to customize searches by years, resource type (ex: book or article), and resource location. A show tips option can provide guidance on how to improve searches. (National Portrait Gallery, n.d.-d).</li>
<li>The advanced search option allows users to use a Boolean or compound search by title. Author, words, and other publication information. Advanced search tips are listed to provide further guidance to improve search results.</li>
<li>Simple searches are more helpful compared to the Late Victorian Portraiture simple search options. I can search by name or by a theme. If I search for ‘globe’, results are of varying significance, but all sources containing the word ‘globe’ appear. Among these results are sources about globes in portraiture. A side facet menu can help yield more specific results.</li>
<li>Advanced search options can be particularly useful for thematic searches. If I want to search for equestrian AND portrait, I receive a few helpful results. The faceted options such as media provide me with the option to select the one manuscript result for this search. I only receive a contents note about the manuscript collection, but do not have access to the collections. If I want to view the collection, I would either have to contact the Heinz Archive and Library to see if they can digitize the manuscripts for me for a fee, or I would have to physically travel to the UK.</li>
<li>The advanced search option is equally as helpful if I want to search for Jane Austen AND Family. The physical location of each book is listed as is a link to online databases where the books could be accessed should you have access to those databases. CUA does not have access to some of these books.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Design Evaluation</h4>
   <dl>
     <dt>Response Time</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits – Response time varies. When you begin searches by keyword, response time is usually in the 4 to 5 second range. If you spend more time configuring different searches, the response time either increases or you might receive a Gateway Error message.</dd>
     <dd>Heinz Archive & Library – Response time is fast and typically within 3 seconds.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Interaction Efficiency</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits – Searches require about 3 clicks.</dd>
     <dd>Heinz Archive & Library – Depending on the type of search, searches take between 2 and 3 clicks.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Colors</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits – The color palette is a simple sepia/dark cream type color, with text in black, and search functions in blue. This is nice in contrast to the varying levels of color depicted in paintings/photographs.</dd>
     <dd>Heinz Archive & Library – The color palette is easy on the eyes with a white background, the NPG logo and search functions being blue, and the text being black. This is nice in contrast to the varying colors of the recommended books/titles.</dd?
     <br>
     <dt>Text Layout & Readability</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits & Heinz Archive & Library – The text layout makes the content readable, but users do not have the ability to change font sizes. The neutral color backgrounds do, however make both catalogs easy to read.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Navigation</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits – I felt that the navigation tools left a lot to be desired. While the search options are for the most part self-explanatory, they do not make searches easy for novice users and do not show consistent results.</dd>
     <dd>Heinz Archive & Library – The navigation aids for this catalog are more clear compared to the Later Victorian Portraits catalog, but the advanced search option could provide better navigation aids.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Multi-culturality</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits & Heinz Archive & Library – Both catalogs appeal to a wide range of users, with palatable colors, simple logos, and information representation. There is no option to change the language, so the site is limited to users who can speak English.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Animation and Graphics</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits & Heinz Archive & Library – Both catalogs use images well in a non-distracting way. Iconography for navigation is not as clear as it should be, but search functions are relatively discernable.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Consistency</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits & Heinz Archive & Library – This design element is lacking heavily for both catalogs. Users are met with text walls with instructions on how to use the catalogs, and while the design of both catalogs is relatively consistent, the search functions are not consistent.</dd>
     <br>
     <dt>Establishing Trust</dt>
     <dd>Later Victorian Portraits – There are no easy access ‘about us’ pages. Users are met with a text wall introducing the collection and search functions when they open the catalog, but this can lead to information overload for the user. A user would have to scroll to the very bottom of the webpage to select the NPG’s general ‘About the Gallery’ tab, which relays information about the NPG as a whole, not this specific catalog.</dt>
     <dd>Heinz Archive & Library – This catalog does a lot more to establish trust with users. On the left-hand side of the webpage are options such as ‘Library Information’ and ‘Contact the Archive & Library’, both of which provide information specific to the Heinz Archive & Library.</dd>
    </dl>

<h4>Accessibility</h4>

<p><img src="https://finalprojectimages5.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wave.jpg" 
    alt="Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools (WAVE)"
    class="center" </p>

<p>Using the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE), an online site that evaluates how accessible a webpage is to individuals with disabilities, I will evaluate what is good and what are areas of concern regarding the design of these two catalogs. What is particularly interesting is that while both catalogs give the impression they are structurally different from one another, they both flag for 1 error and 2 alerts, with the error and alerts being the same for both catalogs.

  To start off with positive aspects of design, WAVE notes that the chosen language of the site (English) is properly coded, which can ensure screen readers can read the content. WAVE also notes that the main element or attribute is encoded properly, which aids in page semantics and navigation. An area and a major area of concern is that this page is set to automatically change location or refresh with a meta tag, which makes it challenging for screen readers or keyboard users to use this page. Wave alerted to no headings being a concern, as this can make it difficult for assistive technology users to navigate the page. WAVE also alerted to a noscript element, which means JavaScript is disabled. The majority of assistive devices rely on JavaScript, so unless an accessible version of scripted content is made available, this page is not very accessibility friendly.</p>


<h4>Usability Test & Observations</h4>
<ul>
<li>To make sure my observations are not biased, I created a usability test on search functions and observed a small group of 5 participants of different ages and comfort levels using search catalogs.</li>
<li>To my surprise, my youngest participant, a new high school graduate who is good at finding information online, struggled the most in using both catalogs.</li>
<li>For the Later Victorian Portraits catalog, half of my participants were not fond of the text wall of instructions, all of my participants received a different number of results for a specified keyword search, half my participants experienced a Gateway Timeout when trying different variations of Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s name, and the majority said there were no notices of mistakes or ways to recover from mistakes.</li>
<li>For the Heinz Archive & Library, all of my participants succeeded in a thematic search, all of my participants received a different number of results for each variation of Rossetti’s name (which confused me as two searches for Rossetti yielded different numbers). All of my participants struggled to receive the desired number of results for a Boolean search.</li>
</ul>

<p>For my usability yest, my 5 participants were asked to answer/complete a set of 25 questions/taks. Below is an interactive sample of some of the questions and tasks my participants answered/completed during their test times. General questions asking about first impressions and what participants liked and disliked about each system were asked twice, with each catalog being evaluated in different segments.</p>

<label for="On your own, were you able to quickly find the webpage, or did it take you a while to find the webpage?">On your own, were you able to quickly find the webpage, or did it take you a while to find the webpage? :</label>

<h3>Part III</h3>

<p><img src="https://finalprojectimages5.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/rossettifamily-1.jpg" 
    alt="Artist siblings Christina Georgina Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Frances Mary Lavina Rossetti, and William Michael Rossetti"
    class="center" </p>


<p>
In summation, if a working group can apply my objectives of evaluating both user friendliness & accessibility to all individuals, including those with assistive devices, the National Portrait Gallery could truly have a website that is available to all.
